## Purpose

The idea is for participants to learn about perspective.

- `Type:` Short Intro Game
- `Time Needed:` 5-10 Minutes
- `Number of people per team:` All

## Supplies Needed

- Your Index Finger !

## The Goal of the game

The goal of the game is for participants to learn about perspective, that all things should be seen relative to a user's point of view. You can learn to see things from other peoples' perspective.

1. Using your index finger raised above your head
2. Start rotating index finger in a clockwise motion whilst watching your own finger
3. Slowly move your index finger lower down below eye level to around your waist
4. Question - as you watch, what direction is your finger spinning when you get lowest (Anticlockwise ? Clockwise ?). How can this be !!

## Rules for playing the game

1. No rules, just gameplay

## Debrief:

- The view of Clockwise or Anticlockwise finger spinning at the end is relative to the observer's point of view.
- This is true about many issues and problems in life.
- Some participants may not see the Clockwise -> Anticlockwise change, ask them to watch there finger more closely !
